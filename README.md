# A11Y Components Playground

The purpose of this project is to have an interactive playground for anyone to test components in the [a11y-components repository](https://github.com/ashleemboyer/a11y-components), which will be a cleaner, more reusable set of components created through the ["Build an Accessible React Component" live-streaming series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOmKTF_wUDoydvtwWrzEw7DZ9VboV51py). It is live at: [a11y-components-playground.netlify.app/](a11y-components-playground.netlify.app/).

You can find a GIF demonstration [in this tweet](https://twitter.com/AshleeMBoyer/status/1292534628650287106) and a text description of the demonstration in the tweets threaded below that.
